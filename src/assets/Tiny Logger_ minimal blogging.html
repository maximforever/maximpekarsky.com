I emailed every alum in the industry, repeatedly. This was before I found Reddit, and I was a regular on a forum called Wall Street Oasis. I soaked up all the advice I could on breaking into the industry, which boiled down to "know your stuff" and "stay persistent until someone gives you a chance." In short, for about a year and a half, I was obsessed with everything related to investment banking.<br><br>90% of my emails didn't get a response. Although the forums warned me this would happen, after months of reaching out, I was pretty discouraged. And then, one day, some mid-level  Wall Street grunt shared posted a message that fundamentally changed the way I think about communication. It went something like:<br><br>&gt; Most of your messages won't get responses, but know that **every email you send is read**. I see them pop up in my inbox. Often, I'm too busy to respond right away.  Then I forget, so sometimes I appreciate when you follow up. Sometimes I know I'm can't help, so I don't respond. I know it's demoralizing to keep reaching out, and it can make you feel like you're shouting into the void. But you're not.<br><br>It's now ten years later and although banking is no longer a part of my life, but this lesson stayed with me. I used to think that if my message didn't get a response, it was a personal rejection. Now I find fulfillment in crafting and sending the message. I trust it'll be read, even if I never hear about it again.<br><br>And I've taken it easier on myself, too, because I also get meaningful messages that I want to respond to. I used to try to get back to people right away, and I'd sometimes get stuck in a cycle of guilt and procrastination trying to craft the perfect response. Now I cut myself some slack, and savor the things people say. I try to get back to them when I can, and I accept that my responses will sometimes fall short of what I want to convey.<br><br>It's not perfect; I'm sure most people dislike not hearing back. But I find real comfort in knowing that every message I send is read, even if I don't get a response.</div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
