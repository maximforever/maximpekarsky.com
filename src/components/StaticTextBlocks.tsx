    <p>
      I&apos;m a product-driven senior full-stack web developer.
      I specialize in intuitive data-driven UIs and performant front-end architecture.
      I feel equally comfortable prototyping a new app or building features on top of a legacy codebase.
      In addition to my engineering work, I'm involved in hiring and team learning and development.
      I regularly write and teach.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&apos;m currently helping build <a href="https://www.executeprogram.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> Execute Program</a> (the best place to learn TypeScript on the web) and writing for the <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/author/maxpekarsky/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> StackOverflow blog</a>.
      In the past, I worked on engineering and product teams at 
      <a href="https://www.activestewardship.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> CAS</a>,{" "}
      <a href="https://www.bonus.ly" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> Bonus.ly</a>,{" "}

      <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/index.page" target="blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NYC Mayor&apos;s Office.</a>{" "}
      I attended the <a href="https://recurse.com" target="blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Recurse Center</a> and can't recommend it enough.

    <p>
      Outside of work, I&apos;m always building useful tools. My latest projects are <a href="https://www.tinylogger.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TinyLogger</a>, a minimal blogging platform<a href="https://www.gem.fm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> GemFM</a>, a podcast episode recommendation app, and <a href="https://www.hackterms.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> Hackterms</a>, the Urban Dictionary for programming terms.

    <p>
      I'm available for freelance work. <a href="mailto:pekarsky.maxim@gmail.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Say hello</a> - I'd love to help you build your next product!

      I am a product engineer: my first goal is to build build useful tools for myself and others.
      I am always tinkering on a project in my spare time.
      Coding is another means of creative expression, and as I get better at my craft, I get better at my art.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use many of my projects on a regular basis: I blog on <a href="https://www.tinylogger.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tinylogger</a>, the blogging platform I built,
      and track my daily spending on <a href="https://www.mytrakr.app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Trakr</a>.
      Several of my projects now have other users; so, when I struggle with a new concept, I check <a href="https://hackterms.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hackterms</a>.
      And soon, I hope to discover new great podcast episodes on <a href="https://gem.fm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GemFM</a>.

      From my work at <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://www.executeprogram.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> Execute Program</a> to
      writing for <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/authors/maxpekarsky/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> StackOverflow blog</a> and on my <a href="https://www.tinylogger.com/max" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">blog</a>,
      I&apos;ve always stayed close to the intersection of coding, writing, and teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing is an indispensible tool: it helps me organize my thoughts, clearly communicate my ideas, and hopefully encourage the next generation of developers.
      When I started to code, I benefitted from many excellent tutorials.
      I also felt overwhelmed by the endless stream of interconnected concepts.
      So, I often write a lot about topics I struggled with, breaking them down in ways I wish they were explained to me.
