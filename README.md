# MaximPekarsky.com

This is the version 3 of [my personal portfolio](www.https://maximpekarsky.com). Its goal is to showcase my programming project and writing code in an intuitive, performant, accessible way.

## Stack
* React (with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) toolchain)
* Typescript
* [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

## Run instructions
* make sure you have Node installed
* clone the repo and `npm install`
* `npm start`

## Deploy
Build the static site with `npm build`.
I then deploy this to firebase.
`npm run deploy` to build and deploy the site.
